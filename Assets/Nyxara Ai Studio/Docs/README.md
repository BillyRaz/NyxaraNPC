# Nyxara AI Studio

Fully local AI companion system for Unity — no API or cloud required.

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Import the package  
2. Download any optional external dependencies you want to use  
3. Open `Nyxara AI > Studio > Setup Wizard`
4. Browse to your downloaded files and click install  
5. Open `Nyxara AI > Studio`
6. Assign character  
7. Click `Build Studio`  
8. Click `Finalize Companion Root Prefab`  
9. Press Play and test

## Important

Nyxara AI Studio supports external AI integrations (LLMUnity, Whisper, Piper).

The package compiles and the demo scene loads in a clean Unity project without these dependencies installed.

These are NOT required for importing the package.

Nyxara Setup Wizard does not download anything or connect to external services. It only copies files or folders that the user manually selects inside Unity into the correct project locations.

If not installed:
- AI generation is disabled
- Speech-to-text is disabled
- Text-to-speech is disabled

The project will still import and run without errors.

Nyxara AI Studio is a Unity editor and runtime tool for turning ARKit-compatible 3D characters into AI companions with a one-click setup flow.

It is built for creators who want a practical local-first workflow inside Unity: set up a character, build a studio root, finalize a companion prefab, and test speech, lip sync, and status tools from one place.

## External Dependencies (LLM and STT required for full functionality, TTS optional)

Nyxara AI Studio relies on external tools for AI, speech, and runtime processing.

These are NOT included in the package and must be installed separately.

  [https://github.com/Macoron/whisper.unity](https://github.com/Macoron/whisper.unity)
If the package does not install correctly via Package Manager, you may download and import it manually from the repository.

- **Piper TTS** (Local text-to-speech)

## ⚙️ External Setup (Inside Unity)

After downloading the optional external tools, use Nyxara Setup Wizard to place them into the correct locations automatically.

1. Open:
   Nyxara AI → Studio → Setup Wizard

2. Browse and install what you want to use:

   - LLM `.gguf`
   - Whisper Unity package folder
   - Whisper model
   - Piper runtime folder
   - Piper voice `.onnx`

3. Open:
   Nyxara AI → Studio

4. Go to the **Status** tab and verify the paths and status fields:
   - LLM Model Status → Found
   - Whisper Model Status → Found
   - Voice Output Status → Ready (if configured)

Voice output is optional.  
If Piper is not configured, Nyxara AI Studio will still work using text-based responses.

The wizard only works with files or folders the user manually selects. It does not download anything or connect to external services automatically.
