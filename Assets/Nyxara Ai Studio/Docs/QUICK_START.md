# Quick Start

## 1. Import

Import the Nyxara AI Studio package into your Unity project.

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

Download the optional external systems you want to use:

- LLMUnity (Local LLM)
- Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- Piper (Text-to-Speech, optional)

(See README for links)

---

## 3. Run Setup Wizard

Open:
Nyxara AI → Studio → Setup Wizard

Use the wizard to browse to the files or folders you already downloaded.

- Select your `.gguf` file for LLM
- Select your downloaded Whisper integration folder if you want the wizard to import the Whisper Unity package
- Select your Whisper model file
- Optionally select your Piper runtime folder
- Optionally select your Piper voice `.onnx`

Click install for each dependency or use `Install All`.

The wizard only copies files you manually select. It does not download anything or connect to external services.

---

## 4. Open Studio

Open:
Nyxara AI → Studio

---

## 5. Verify External Paths

Go to the **Status** tab.

The wizard should already update the paths automatically.

Verify status:
- LLM Model Status → Found
- Whisper Model Status → Found
- Voice Output Status → Ready (if configured)

---

## 6. Setup Character

- Assign your ARKit-compatible character
- Confirm face renderer is detected

---

## 7. Build

Click:

Build Studio  
→ Apply Rig (if needed)  
→ Finalize Companion Root Prefab  

---

## 8. Test

- Enter Play Mode  
- Trigger input (mic or test input)  
- Verify AI response (text)

If Piper is configured:
- Verify voice playback + lip sync

---

## 9. Validate

Use:

- Status tab  
- Diagnostics  
- Lip Sync test  
- Full System Test  

---

## Notes

- Voice output is optional.  
- If Piper is not configured, Nyxara AI Studio will still work using text-based responses.  
- If dependencies are not installed, Nyxara AI Studio will still import and run, but AI, speech-to-text, and voice features will remain disabled until configured.
- Nyxara Setup Wizard does not download or auto-connect to anything outside the Unity project. It only copies files or folders you manually choose.
